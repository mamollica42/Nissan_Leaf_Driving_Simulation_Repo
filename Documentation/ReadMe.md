## Signoffs

Signoffs are the detailed designs for different components. Signoffs include the analysis for each design specification, images of the schematics for the implementation, and the bill of materials for the components. These documents are the details for each subsystem in the total project. 

## 3D Models

The models posted here are derived from the signoffs. The signoffs include images of the models, but this folder houses the files that contain the designs to be opened in drawing software. Most files were drawn in AutoCAD and uploaded as a .stl file. The 'Final **** Assembly' file in each subfolder is all other pieces in the folder combined into the implemented design.

### Wiring Schematics

Schematics posted here were drawn in KiCAD from the signoffs, and they represent the wiring for components in the subsystems. Images of the schematics were posted in the signoffs, but this is the downloadable files to view in drawing software.
