------

## The function of the small part Subsystem
The headlight must send data to the Master microcontroller, and data received by the microcontroller will be a digital signal. 
The digital signal will represent the off, on, high, and low beams to indicate to the microcontroller. Also, The headlight will send data to the microcontroller if it blinks left, right, or both.

### Specification & constraints
   - The headlight shall connect to the Master Microcontroller.
   - The headlight shall produce an output that matches the voltage to the microcontroller and keep the voltage at the same level for the headlight.
   - The headlight shall be powered by the vehicle
