MASTER MICROCONTROLLER
------------------------
### Function of the Subsystem
The master microcontroller (MMCU) must receive data from four seperate local microcontrollers that interface with the
sensors in other subsystems. This MMCU will read serial data from each local MCU and then send that data to the PC to
be processed in the simulation.

### Specifications & Constraints
- Must connect to no less than four local microcontrollers
- Must provide real-time data transfer
- Shall connect to the PC running the simulation
- Shall have sufficient GPIO pins for communication protocols
- Shall be powered by the PC
