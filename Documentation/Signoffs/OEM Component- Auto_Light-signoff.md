OEM Component Subsystem- Auto Light
------

## The function of the Auto Light Subsystem
The Master microcontroller will receive the output of the Nissan Leaf AutoLight in this part of the subsystem. Furthermore, the Master microcontroller will detect if the headlight is off, on, blinking, and high and low beams.

### Specification & constraints
   - Must detect high beam,low beam, left indicator, and right indicator
   - Must use OEM componets as the inputs
   - The signal input must not exceed 5 V 
   - Implement a way to protect the signal from voltage varying from 10 V to 15 V
   - Current to the signal must be less than 1 percent of the current to the light
   - Prevent interference among signals through isolation methods

### Auto Light Wiring Diagram
The auto light wiring diagram shows the whole wiring for each component in the headlight of the Nissan Vehicle. However, the main focus are the Headlamp relays shown in Figure 1 and they link to the headlamps. This displays how the low beam and high beam functions operate and make the headlight indicate. The wiring diagram reveals that the battery is attached to the CPU through the relay showing that the relay receives power from the battery, but the current is operated by the CPU. The input from the battery is also connected to one side of the relay switch. This means that the input to the lamp and headlight should be 12 V. Also, figure 1 shows that their fuse connects to the output of the relay, and the fuse can take up to 10 amps. Overall, the key point is to see the headlamp relay, what is connected, and how it works. 


### Design Voltage 
From the information in Auto Light Wiring diagram, a method to detect the output of the relay can be created. The design shown in figure 2 is to splice and add a voltage divider to connect to the microcontroller. This process uses the 12 V potential that is sent to the lamp to illuminate the light to trigger a reaction on the microcontroller. 

The design behind the Voltage Divider is to reduce the auto light voltage to 5v and have a current of less than 1% of the current to the light.  The design then uses 5 mA as the maximum current to be conducted through the divider since 1% of the current to the light is 47.9 mA. Through Ohm's law, the total resistance is found to be approximately 3.1 kOhms. To achieve 5 V between two resistors, 1.8 kOhms and 1.3 kOhms are used in series, respectively. To meet the constraint of the input varying from 10V to 15V, the maximum current is 4.89 mA, and the minimum current is 3.23 mA. This mean the maximum current would not exceed the 5 mA limit and the 1% current constraint stated prior. 

However, the design with only a voltage divider has a potential risk due to the chance of a voltage spike reaching the microcontroller and interference from other signals. This design shows the vulnerability to signal interferece through the shared ground terminal and the ability for the current to backfeed onto another divider. The voltage divider also allows the chance of the signal voltage to exceed the limit of 5 V due to a spike in the input voltage on the lamp node. The design was modified to include optoisolators to remidy the hazards of both constraints as shown in Figure 2. The optoisolator will take reduced voltage from the Nissan Vehicle and convert it into a light signal. Then a photosensor will detect the light signal and allow the 5 V to pass through the pin of the microcontroller. The LED that is used to trigger the photosensor also prevents any backfeed current from false triggering a signal. This isolates both systems so that the voltage to the lights does not have a direct path to the signal input. With the microcontroller being used for the 5 V supply in the signal, there should not be a voltage spike to the controller since it would have to be generated by the controller. 

## Analysis

From the Datasheet

Forward Current = 5 mA  for opto-isolation[3]

The Voltage divider will need to produce an output 5 V and keep the range 5 mA

Voltage divider

Vout = Vin ${ R2 \over R1+R2}$

5V = 12V ${ 1.3 \ k \over 1.8 \ k + 1.3 \ k}$

$Total \ Resistance: 3.2 \ k= {1.8 \ k+1.3 \ k}$ 

$Max \ current:4.84 \ mA= {15V \over3.1k}$

$Min \ current: 3.23\ mA = {10V\over3.1k}$

Test different voltages going through Voltage Divider(10 to 15)

Test different voltages going through Voltage Divider(0 to 20 )

To Prevent OverCurrent: The design need a fuse of 5mA. As shown in figure2.



### Summary
Based on Research, the Auto light from Figure 1, and the Sylvania H13 XtraVision Halogen Headlight Bulb[1], the voltage going through the headlight is 12 volts, and the current is in the range of 4.0 to 4.7 amp. Furthermore, based on the information, I gather that the current won't affect the device, but the voltage will.
 

| Part   | Cost   | Qty| total|
|-------:|:------:|:--:|:----:|
|1.8 kohms| $0.15 |  5 |$0.75 | 
|1.3 kohms| $0.11 |  5 |$0.55 |
|LTV-817*| $0.24  | 10 | $2.40|

*4 are required. It is the same cost for 10 as it is 6. This provides extras in the event of multiple isolators failing.
