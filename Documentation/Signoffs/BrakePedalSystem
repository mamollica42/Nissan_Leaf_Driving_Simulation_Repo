Brake Pedal Position System
--------------------------------------
### Function of the Subsystem
The brake pedal position system will take the OEM signal from the brake pedal by splicing into the signal wires and input them to the local microcontroller. 
The local microcontroller will then calculate the position based the change of the voltage from the OEM Anti-Brake System (ABS) Decelerator sensor.

### Specifications & Constraints
- Must use OEM brake pedal 
- Must not have any exposed or loose wires according to NESC standard
- Must send voltage in the range that changes with pedal position 
- Must have wires able to handle 6 V and 1 A 
- Must have microcontroller able to recieve signal from brake system and accelerator system
- Shall have an accurate measure if the position
- Shall send position signal to local microcontroller
