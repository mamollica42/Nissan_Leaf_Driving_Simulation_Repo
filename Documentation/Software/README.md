This folder contains the code for the Master MCU, Shifter, Speedometer, and CAN Bus subsystems. All files are .ino extension.

##### _*Note: CAN Capture Code is example code found at the following link created by the manufacturer of the CAN Bus Shield for Arduino, Seeed Studio. It is not original code and Team 8 takes no credit for its creation._

### How to Run?
Each .ino file must be downloaded in a folder **with the same name as file**. For example, a file named "myFile.ino" must be placed in a folder named "myFile" so that Arduino IDE can recognize it properly. Once downloaded and in a folder with the same name, simply open the files in Arudino IDE to run and edit.
