SPEEDOMETER SUBSYSTEM ANALYSIS
--------------------

### Specifications & Constraints
- C1. Shall be powered by the PC running the simulator via USB 2.0
-	C2. Microcontroller must be able to read speed data from the simulator while it is running using serial communication
-	C3. Data must exit the PC running the simulator and be stored on a microcontroller using serial communication
-	C4. Shall display the speed data in an appropriate manner on a screen inside the car

### Analysis
