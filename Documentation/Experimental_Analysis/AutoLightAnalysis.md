# AutoLight Subsystem Experimental Analysis
### I. Specification & constraints
  - Must detect the auto light high beams, low beams, and left and right indicators with a voltage of no more than 5 volts and a current below 40 milliamps.
   - Must use OEM componets as the inputs
   - The signal input from the autolight must not exceed 5 V 
   - Implement a way to protect the signal from the input voltage varying from 10 V to 15 V
   - Current to the signal must be less than 1 percent of the current to the light
   - Prevent interference among signals through isolation methods

### II. Analysis
   1) *Must detect the auto light high beams, low beams, and left and right indicators with a voltage of no more than 5 volts and a current below 40 milliamps.*
