# Lessons Learned
----------
### Michael Mollica
1. The overall project approach of tapping into existing sensors worked tremendously well. Additionally, the steering system using a rotary encoder was a fantastic approach to capturing steering angle. However, our initial choice of local MCUs for each subsystem did not go well. This was a failure and ended up being almost completely void by the end of the project. The subsystem breakdown and organization was a success regardless of the modifications made to the design choices.
2. The largest unanticipated problem was the UART communication with 4 MCUs. This was almost never working properly and should have never been the approach to the system design in the first place. The other slight problem was the shifter debouncing when switching from neutral to drive or reverse. This was discovered late in the process of experimentation but was able to be fixed with some software changes.
3. I would make the system dependent on a single MCU for each subsystem because of the issues with UART. This was the most avoidable issue, but also the biggest setback in our project.
4. Some best practices I have learned through this project is to heavily document and comment code, keep all old and new versions of code, keep track of all experimental results, and never assume something will work without testing it.
5. Do not expect everything to work how it was designed. There is so many extraneous errors and mistakes that can occur when physically connecting devices and when designing complex systems. Always have a backup plan and always test your devices extensively.
6. I have learned to program in Arduino much better than I had early in college. I have also learned a lot more about how serial communication works and its proper use.

### Brett Harden
1. The detail design and implementation went well for the group, but the technical proposals were a struggle. The project started off rough since most of us had issues with stating and understanding all components required in the project proposal and conceptual design. Both of these tasks were new learning experiences for everyone since it was different from prior class projects. Once the project progressed to the detail designs and implementation, the team settled in and was able to work well together to complete the tasks. This portion was similar processes to those of prior classes with final projects, and everyone was confident in their abilities. These two phases showed to be a night and day difference for the group's success.
2. There were several unanticipated issues within most subsystems. The issues that I was responsible for consisted of the steering gears and power installation. I had issues with getting the gears spaced properly since there was not an exact or direct distance that I could measure. In result, I had to go through several iterations of the gear design to find the correct fit. This also included changing the plane in which the gears were printed because there were issues with layers pulling apart.
3. I would have approached capstone 1 differently. I approached capstone 2 with a mentality of "attack the task before it attacks you" and it made it so much easier. I also would have moved quicker to install the components to ensure that the required wiring was included. This ended up wasting a lot of time that could have been prevented due to finding required ground wires that were needed with the power supply.
4. Best practices for me include being open to not having to know all details for all components. It makes life much easier when the work is shared and everyone is able to focus on their own work. Communication is key for this process, but it makes most work easier when you only have to focus on a small amount of a large project. 
5. I would advise to always attack the task at hand. You never want to be the person that everyone is waiting on, and this includes the team waiting for feedback. It is always better to have your stuff done quick to avoid tardiness.
6. The biggest skill that I learned for our project was AutoCAD. I was responsible for the 3-dimensional drawings for the entire project and had to learn AutoCAD Mechanical to complete them. I spent about 200 hours learning and designing all the components, and this accounts for most of the new skills that I learned. 

### Chase Colotta
1. The project went very well for this group. We had some trouble understanding the problem and finding an approach at the beginning of capstone. After some clarification we got on the right track and finished the design signoffs on time. The design were good even though we change some systems on implementation like the pedals going straight to the master MCU. We meet all deadlines well and finished what was asked of us for this project. 
2. A unexpected problem that occurred was that the master MCU was not reading the four UART communcations withouts problems occurring. One problem that happened to my subsystem is that one of my brake pedal sensors that work during testing outside of the car did not work once installed back into the vehicle. 
3. I would have liked to have it plugged into a simulator to see everything come together. 
4. The best practices I have learned is to be adaptable like when the local MCU's wasn't talking to the master. I also learned the importance of documenting the process.
5. Do not think everything will go smoothly. You are going to have to put in the work of designing it and be able to make things work if the designs don't work perfectly. Have a good understanding of the goal and accomplish it however you can. 
6. I gained the knowledge of completely designing something from the ground up and the documentation needed to record the steps. I have a much better understanding of how to read wiring schematics. 

### Gerardo Mateo
1.  Overall, as a group, we were able to accomplish the project. At the start of the semester, there were some challenges in understanding the project goal. Eventually, the group understood its goal by working hard and being patient. Furthermore, both technical and organization meet the requirement that the team wanted. However, during the planning of the subsystem, we were able to break down and find the right equipment for each subsystem. Although each sensor worked perfectly, the local MCU did not, so the team decided to reduce the number to one. On the other hand, each of the new modifications to the project helped to improve and complete our project.
2. The unanticipated problem that occurred in my subsystem was that it needed a pull-down resistor. Because of this, Arduinos were unable to determine the ground state. However, the major unanticipated problem was that simulation was not working since the group needed it to put data into the simulation. However, the group was aware that we were able to extract data from the sensor.
3. If I were to start over, I would do more research and finish the assignment early. In addition, a better understanding of how the sign-off work early would help reduce stress and time waste.
4.  Communication with teammates and asking for help when needed are the best practices I picked up. Furthermore, documenting information and commenting on your code makes it easier to understand what you're doing and where you're stopping. Also, giving good detail on what your subsystem does will help you in the future.
5. The word of wisdom I would give is to do your research early and have a backup plan for each subsystem or whole project. Also, save other information even if you don't need it because it could help you in the future. Also, the major wisdom is communicating with the team and helping each other if needed. However, alway expect the unexpect in each subsystem or project.
6. What I learn from the project is to communicate with the team and document information in good detail for others to understand what I'm doing. Also, I learned to plan on a wiring diagram and show the connection of the circuit that I'm creating. Overall, I learned how to plan early in the project and how to document each piece of information I gather.

### Ethan Powers
1. Overall, I think the project went well. Tapping into the OEM sensors of the car proved to be the most successful way to capture all of the inputs. The main failure for the project was the intention of using 3 local MCUs. The master MCU could only handle UART communication for one local MCU, so this proved to be a major problem. Steering and pedals were changed to send inputs to master MCU, so the problem was fixed. Having everything organized in github made the completion of the project much easier.
2. An unanticipated problem was the simulator not working. This led to the team to not be able to send inputs and receive outputs from it. This didn't play a huge portion in the success of the project, but it would have been exciting to see the car talking with the simulator. The other unanticipated problem was mentioned in the answer for question 1.
3. I would do more research before trying to complete the conceptual design. The conceptual design differed completley from the end product. This ended up in more work for sign offs. This made the sign off portion of the class a lot more stressful.
4. The best practices I picked up on were to make sure to document everything you change in the project and make sure that your subsystem works before permanently installing hardware. 
5. Do your research early and get ahead early. The more deadlines you make, the easier your life is.
6. I learned how to program with Arduino and experiment with wiring diagrams to confirm that they are true.
