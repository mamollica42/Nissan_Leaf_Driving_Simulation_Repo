# Final Deliverables

The outline of the final report is given below.


**Introduction:**

· Background information 

		This can largely be copied with some updates from the proposal and phase 1

· Motivational Analysis 

		This can largely be copied from the proposal

· Problem Formulation

		This can largely be copied from the proposal

· Constraints 

		This can be copied from the proposal, phase 1, and phase 2

· Overall idea 

		This can be copied from the proposal

· Salient outcomes 

		This is required to be in this document and the github. Write it once and copy it to both places. 

· How the report is organized

		As you did in the proposal, explain the order and layout of this document.

**Literature Review:**

· Currently available solutions on the market or in the research literature

· Engineering standards

**Methodology:**

· Theory and Overall Idea of your Solution: 

· Complete Design Process

· _Does your methodology consider following items – If it does consider an item in the list then justify how you made that consideration. If it does not consider then state why you think this design does not require to consider this item (you design may not consider these items but you still need to justify why it does not require to consider these items): - copy and update_

o _Public Health_

o _Public Safety and Welfare_

o _Global, cultural, social, environmental and economic factors_



**Results and Discussion:**

· State the results in proper tabular, graphical or combination of both 

		The experimental results are already in journal entries as well as required in the github. Copy them here.

· What are the deliverables

		What did the team intend to deliver at the end of the project? What did you actually deliver?

**Timeline and Cost Estimates of the Project:**

· _State how the goals were set and what goals were set_

· _How the tasks were planned_

· _How often you reviewed the tasks and revised the goals when objectives were not met_

· _Explain all the process with the help of a Gant chart. – copy from github_

· _How you distributed the tasks among the group members_

· _Cost estimate and actual cost of the project – (e.g. development cost and production (per unit) cost) – copy from github_


**Ethical and Professional Responsibilities:**

· How your project warrants you to be aware of your ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations.

· Does your project consider global, economic, environmental and societal contexts and make informed judgments – one project may not consider all the contexts but you need to provide a justification why one item is more important over other in your particular project.


**Lessons Learned:**

· Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well? What unanticipated problems occurred? What would you do differently if you were to do it over again? What “best practices” have you identified? What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students? 


**Conclusions:**

· Summary of the project accomplishments. Conclusion which relates accomplishments to project objectives. Future directions the project could take.


**Appendix:**

· Additional material as appropriate.

· Individual statements – one per team member

o _List relevant knowledge and skills learned in other courses_

o _State what new knowledge you gained during the course of this project, how you acquired that knowledge, and how it is important to the project_
