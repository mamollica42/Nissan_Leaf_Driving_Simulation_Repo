# Nissan Leaf Driving Simulation

## Executive Summary

The Nissan Leaf Driving Simulation is a long-term goal for the ECE and ME Departments at TNTECH. This project consists of data acquistion and initial hardware setup for the future simulation to be built off of. The hopes of the final product are to accurately replicate the look and feel of driving a Nissan Leaf without the actual motion of the vehicle.


## Capabilities

This repository currently contains finalized documents for the project, but future work will be done and uploaded once complete. The proposal contains the specifications and solutions to complete this project over the course of the next several months. The conceptual design layouts out the "what" for the implementation of each subsystem of the overall design. Further details on the "how" can be seen in the Documentation folder and their supporting analysis can be viewed in the Signoffs folder.


## Salient Outcomes
